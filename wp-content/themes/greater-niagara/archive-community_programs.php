<h1>
	Here, we'll have a blurb describing the type of community outreach work that Greater Niagara Mechanical
	engages in. Should we add contact info (like a special email address) for organizations to 
	reach out? We'll also make sure to call out that these are Buffalo / Western New York-area 
	programs to add a little SEO juice.
